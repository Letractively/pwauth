[Introduction Pwauth] will always exit with one of the status codes listed in the table below.

Codes 50 and above usually represent configuration errors in pwauth.

||  0  || STATUS_OK || Login OK. ||
||  1  || STATUS_UNKNOWN || Nonexistant login or (for some configurations) incorrect password. ||
||  2  || STATUS_INVALID || Incorrect password (for some configurations).  ||
||  3  || STATUS_BLOCKED || Uid number is below MIN_UNIX_UID value configured in config.h. ||
||  4  || STATUS_EXPIRED || Login ID has expired. ||
||  5  || STATUS_PW_EXPIRED || Login's password has expired. ||
||  6  || SSTATUS_NOLOGIN || Logins to system have been turned off (usually by /etc/nologin file). ||
||  7  || STATUS_MANYFAILES || Limit on number of bad logins exceeded. ||
|| 50  || STATUS_INT_USER || pwauth was invoked by a uid not on the SERVER_UIDS list.  If you get this error code, you probably have SERVER_UIDS set incorrectly in pwauth's config.h file. ||
||  51 || STATUS_INT_ARGS || pwauth was not given a login & password to check.  The means the passing of data from mod_auth_external to pwauth is messed up.  Most likely one is trying to pass data via environment variables, while the other is trying to pass data via a pipe. ||
||  52 || STATUS_INT_ERR || one of several queer internal errors occurred.  You'll have to read the source code to figure these out. ||
||  53 || STATUS_INT_NOROOT || pwauth was not able to read the password database.  Usually this means it is not running as root.  (PAM and login.conf configurations will return 1 in this case.) ||
